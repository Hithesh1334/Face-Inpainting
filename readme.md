# CAPSTONE PROJECT - <u>Complete Face Generation From Partial Face Data</u>
<hr>



### Capstone Pahse - I Summary

1. Problem statement  
2. Scope and feasibility study
3. Literature survey
4. HLD
5. Dataset preparation

In summary, <br>
The Phase 1 of our capstone project set the stage for the upcoming phases by establishing a clear problem statement, assessing project feasibility, conducting an in-depth literature survey, defining a High-Level Design, and curating a suitable dataset. These preliminary steps have laid a robust foundation for the project's progression into the subsequent phases, where the focus will shift towards algorithm development and model training based on the insights gained during this phase

### Capstone Phase - II progress

1. Preparation of Dataset manually.<br>
   The reason for preparing the data manually is to get realistic dataset which is hard to achive by using automation.<br>
   Our Dataset consist of both synthasied and maunally prepared dataset.
2. Use a code availabe at online to add mask to the faces
3. Data preprocessing.
4. Designing Low level architecute.
5. Code Implementation
6. Test Plans
7. Final report
