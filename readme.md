# Face Generation from Partial Face Data Capstone Project

## Phase I: Project Setup and Preliminary Steps

### Problem Statement
The goal of this capstone project is to develop a system capable of generating complete facial images from partial face data, utilizing both synthesized and manually prepared datasets.

### Scope and Feasibility Study
The project's scope includes dataset preparation, algorithm development, and model training. Feasibility studies were conducted to ensure the viability of achieving realistic results through a combination of synthesized and manually prepared data.

### Literature Survey
An extensive literature survey was conducted to understand existing methodologies and approaches for face generation, deep learning techniques, and related technologies.

### High-Level Design (HLD)
The High-Level Design outlines the overall architecture and approach for the project, providing a roadmap for subsequent phases.

### Dataset Preparation
A suitable dataset was curated, consisting of both synthesized and manually prepared facial data. The manual preparation aimed to ensure realism that might be challenging to achieve through automated means.

## Phase II: 

### Dataset Preparation - Manual Approach
Data preparation involved a manual process to enhance the realism of the dataset, contributing to the diversity and quality of the training data.

### Dataset Synthesis
Synthesized data was generated using available code online, adding variability to the dataset.

### Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps were implemented to clean and format the dataset, preparing it for model training.

### Low-Level Architecture Design
The low-level architecture was designed to specify the details of the algorithm, including data flow, model components, and integration.

### Code Implementation
The code implementation phase involved developing the algorithm based on the high-level and low-level designs.

### Test Plans
Comprehensive test plans were established to validate the functionality, performance, and accuracy of the developed algorithm.

### Final Report
The final report will consolidate findings, results, and insights gained during the project. It will also provide recommendations for future work and improvements.
